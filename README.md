# web-scraping-with-Beautiful-Soup
This project involves scraping product reviews from Amazon using Beautiful Soup. We extract info such as review titles, review text, ratings and the date of the review. The extracted data is just saved into a CSV file. Further analysis, such as sentiment analysis can be done to gain insights into customer opinions and trends.
